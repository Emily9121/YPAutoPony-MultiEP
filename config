# everything after a # is a comment and thus ignored

# these are commands that can be executed on files. (see below)
#
# there are a few special variables, all starting with an underscore:
# _FILE is the complete (globbed) file including path
# _FILE_NAME is the filename without path
# _EPNUM is the number of the episode (beginning of ep name)
# _EPNAME is the name of the ep, fetched from thetvdb, using SEASON and _EPNUM

#
# >> definition of commands
#

# a cmd has a name, and includes everything up to the next empty line
#
# the variables can be formatted in a more complex manner, see:
# http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatspec
# for example, {_EPNAME:02d} will format _EPNAME to be padded with zeroes
# to be two letters long.
		
CMD UNDRM
        java -cp {PATH_REQUIEM} UnDrm "{_FILE}" "{DIR_OUT_UNDRM}/{_FILE_NAME}"


CMD 1R

#
# >> definition of variables
#

#
# these vars have special significance, and need to be set
#

# input directory, this is used as base path for the filenames in commands,
# and there needs to be one DIR_IN_COMMANDNAME for each command!
DIR_IN_1R  C:\Users\Administrator\UnDRM\
DIR_IN_UNDRM  C:\Users\Administrator\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\TV Shows\SomeShow\ # Here goes the iTunes Path

# Just print command 
DRY_RUN no
# season, this is used for tvdb fetching
SEASON 1

#
# all variables below are just used as-is in the cmds above, nothing else
# variables starting with DIR_ will need to be valid directories
# variables starting with PATH_ will need to be valid files
# everything else are just arbitrary variables
#

# requiem path
PATH_REQUIEM C:\yayponies\requiem\requiem.exe
# mkvmerge path
PATH_MKVMERGE C:\MKVToolNix\mkvmerge.exe

# output directory from requiem
DIR_OUT_UNDRM C:\Users\Administrator\UnDRM\
# output directory from mkvmerge
DIR_OUT_1R Z:\ViDeO\


#
# >> actual commands to be executed
#

# every non-comment non-blank line after this will be considered a command
COMMANDS

# the * is a wildcard and completes if the filename is unique
# if you have 1 to 26 in a list like this, you can just un-comment
# the episode you want to process and run the script

# explicit filenames are possible as well, of course
# this one will fail because there is no episode number (for tvdb fetching)
# 7Y SOMETHING BLAH.mp4

#UNDRM 01*
#1R 01*


#...

# this particular config file would try to run the UNDRM, 7T and 7Y commands on
# the "5 Sisterhooves Social.mkv" file, and, and 7T and 7Y on 6 * (resolving
# wildcards)
